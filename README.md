# book-list

### User input all fields then either "Add Book To Read" or "I've Read This One" buttons

### The app will either prepend to the add list or append to the previously read list with the ability to deleted either and all

### If button is clicked without all fields entered, a red warning banner flashes for 3 seconds below Title

### When book is added or deleted, a green success banner flashes for 3 seconds below title

## Technologies

### Originally coded in vanilla ES5 (file es5app.js) using constructors and prototypes

### This posted coded refactored to vanilla ES6 using classes

### Otherwise exactly the same layout and functionality

### Minimal bootstrap style
